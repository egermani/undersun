# Undersun

An open-source sourcebook and a public domain for Weird fantasy, featuring all your favorites -ologies, -omies, and -ics: eco-, taxon-, semiot-, etc. 

Beta release will be an Obsidian vault, but for the alpha this is going to be scraps of ideas as I build out the Bog of Standard, ie the most generic, boilerplate version of a fantasy world, so that other people can scaffold their own creations with it.

Lewis Hyde is a major inspiration for this project, which wants to celebrate the daydreaming & hidden creativity of all those writers who love to make stuff up for sheer love of the game.

Two things I learned from Hyde: the concept of a *potlatch*, a ritual for the Native American of the Pacific Northwest, where you'd give away or set fire to your possessions just to prove you can afford it. Ideas are a dime a dozen? I'm still a millionaire.

And also? *Art is not a commodity.* It's a gift.

> “If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” -- George Bernard Shaw (maybe apocryphal)
